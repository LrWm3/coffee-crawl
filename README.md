# Coffee Crawl fork

Coffee crawl is the first ten floors of crawl, then one floor of Zot.

## Upcoming changes

Trying to 'streamline' the game

- [x] remove lair, orc, vaults, depths
- [x] shorten dungeon to 10 levels
- [x] temple always appears on level 2
- [ ] remove portal branches besides bazaar
- [ ] remove drop restrictions for D1 to D4 to avoid too many 'boring' floors
- [ ] zot traps no longer cast into the abyss
- [ ] map zot enemies to dungeon enemies in random gen
- [ ] map zot enemies to late dungeon enemies
- [ ] nerf zot orb guardians because I don't want to remove them
- [ ] nerf orbs of fire because I don't want to remove them
- [ ] to make orb run easier, nerf or remove panlords
- [ ] to make orb run easier, map other enemies to easier ones
- [ ] end the game when the player exits the realm of zot with the orb. This is to avoid players spending 10 minutes predigging tunnels in a now 25 minute game.

## Extended changes

- [ ] remove dexterity
- [ ] remove bows
- [ ] remove upstairs
