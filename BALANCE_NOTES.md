# Balance Notes

Notes on balancing.

## Seems Weird

TODO - grab my morgue file.

I made it to level 10. I had only trained bows and polearms all game. Seems a bit weird. Maybe all weapon-skills, magic skills, defensive skills and stealth skills should cross-train?

Alternatively, cross training could be across weapons and spells as well...?

## Too Strong

### d10

Ugly things on d10 are really strong. Probably shouldn't be fought without resists.
Stone giants on d10 are definitely too strong.
Death knights are too strong for d10.
Essentially, the Zot treasure vault on d10 feels ridiculous.
Ettin feel too strong.
Fire and Ice giants feel like a bit much.
I don't think any of the threats are too powerful alone, but together its too much.

Essentially the entire vault on D10 is a complete noob trap and needs reworking.

### zot

I enter zot. I haven't found any resists. I encounter my first enemy. Its an electric golem. I get blasted for half my health at range for 46 electric damage. I take another 23 damage in melee and kill the golem in a single hit.

I dispatch a tentacled monstrosity, a moth of wrath, and a draconian without much trouble.

Orb guardians hit for so so much damage but also die almost instantly.

Lance of force from an ancient lich hits me for 52 damage. I don't even know if I balanced ancient liches.

Yeah, ancient liches are too durable and powerful. I can't kill them.

Killer Klown damage also seems astronomical. I think all these bolt spells need to be balanced somehow.

Killer Klown clubs also seem to do 45 dmg a hit. I was unable to kill one. EV too high?

I think pretty much everything does too much damage. 10 to 20 points could come off everything and it could still be too hard.
