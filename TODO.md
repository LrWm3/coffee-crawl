# TODO

Ideas or changes I would like to make are here.

## v2 TODO

This is primarily based on feedback from other users right now. I'll address these before moving onto other changes.

### Features

Planned features for v2.

- [ ] Remove upstairs.
- [ ] Replace one dungeon floor (D9) with single floor vault quadrant.
- [ ] Replace one dungeon floor (D8) with a single depths floor.
- [ ] Remove shafts.
- [ ] Tighten up range spill-over altars appear in.
- [ ] Players start with a full spellbook.

### Balance changes

Planned balance changes to existing functionality for v2.

- [ ] Endgame damage is swingy; incoming and outgoing damage very high. would be nice if less one-shots in both directions. Apparently draconians were getting slaughtered with regular rocks!
- [ ] Balance zot and depths' uniques which appear in Zot and around Zot entrances.
- [ ] Increase difficulty of enemies in the later part of the dungeon.
- [ ] Stealth should not cross-train with other skills as it breaks the flow of the game for non-stealth oriented characters.
- [ ] Range is too powerful.
- [ ] Endgame monster skills need to be scaled down, and HD needs to be increased to compensate to create more balanced monsters.
- [ ] Direct damage spell-casting is likely very strong. Revisit after other balancing changes made.

### Fixes

Planned bugfixes for v2.

- [ ] Abyss entrances are still appearing in Zot.
- [ ] '\' still crashes the game.

cross-training (ie: all weapons skills cross-train) and green for special cross-training (ie: fire-magic and axes).
