<!-- Use the standard crawl bug-report template if you've encountered a bug. -->

**DESCRIPTION:**
*Describe what the problem is.*

**SUGGESTION:**
*If you have any ideas on how to address the problem, provide them here. It's 
ok if you don't!*

**EXTRA FILES:**
*Please include any morgue files, crashlogs, save files here, or extra
screenshots here.*

*To upload a save file directly to github, compress it to a .zip archive, and
then github will accept the upload. (It will not take a .cs file directly.)*
